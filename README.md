# Tableau Equality & Device Health Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes device health and equality indicators across multiple factories using interactive Tableau visualizations.  
The objective is to identify unhealthy device patterns and compare performance across locations.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Tableau
- Microsoft Excel
- GitHub

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains device-level health metrics collected from multiple factories, including:
- Berlin
- Meiyo
- Seiko
- Shenzhen

📂 Location: `data/Task 5 Equality Table.xlsx`

## 📈 Dashboard Output
The Tableau dashboard visualizes:
- Unhealthy device counts by factory
- Device-type-wise health comparison
- Factory-level performance insights

📂 Location: `dashboard/tableau_project_task1.pdf`

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Certain factories show consistently higher unhealthy device counts
- Specific device types contribute disproportionately to overall risk
- Clear scope for predictive maintenance and operational optimization

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download the dataset from the `data` folder
2. Open Tableau
3. Recreate or extend the dashboard using the provided data
4. Compare insights across factories
